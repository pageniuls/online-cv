    intro: >
    I mainly worked on coding theory and mathematical modeling. For coding theory, I worked with professor Nuh Aydin, mainly on quasi-cyclic, quasi-twsited, multi-twisted, polycyclic, and quantum codes.
    |
       Also, I'm really interested in mathematical modeling in using statistic and differential equation.
