    assignments:
    
    title: Research: Color Analysis on painting
    intro: > 
    Made a program to slice paintings into pixels, with focus on Fauvism; by probablistic analysis and statistical analysis on the color of pixels, we are going to analyze the preferences of colors of five main artists of Fauvism.
We are going to use Freud analysis to discover the reasons why artists have such preferences and find out the connection between color preferences and historical background.

publications:
    title: Publications
    intro: I mainly worked on coding theory and mathematical modeling. For coding theory, I worked with professor Nuh Aydin, mainly on quasi-cyclic, quasi-twsited, multi-twisted, polycyclic, and quantum codes.
    |
       Also, I'm really interested in mathematical modeling in using statistic and differential equation.
