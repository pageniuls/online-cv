    intro: |
        I mainly worked on coding theory and mathematical modeling. For coding theory, I worked with professor Nuh Aydin, mainly on quasi-cyclic, quasi-twsited, multi-twisted, polycyclic, and quantum codes. Also, I'm really interested in mathematical modeling in using statistic and differential equation.
    papers:
      - title: Good Classical and Quantum Codes from Multi-Twisted Codes

        authors: Nuh Aydin, Thomas Guidotti, Peihan Liu
        conference: Finite Fields and Their Applications, 2020

      - title: "New Linear Codes as Quasi-Twisted Codes from Long Constacyclic Codes"
        link: "https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00604"
        authors: Nuh Aydin, Thomas Guidotti, Peihan Liu
        conference: "17th IEEE Internation Workshop on Algebraic and Combinatorial Coding Theory, 2020"
